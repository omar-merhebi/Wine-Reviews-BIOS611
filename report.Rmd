# Predicting Wine Quality and Price

## Introduction
For this project, I am attempting to see if we can use a relatively simple neural network to predict the price and quality of wine based on a text-based description by a reviewer as well as some other characteristics such as its year and country/region of origin. The quality in this dataset is determined by the number of points assigned by Wine Magazine. 

## Preliminary Data Exploration
First, we want to take a look at overall trends and patterns in this dataset. First, I will take a look at the distribution of the target variables (price and points). First let's take a look at points:

knitr::include_graphics('./figures/histogram-by-price-full.png')
knitr::include_graphics('./figures/histogram-by-price-no-outliers.png')
```
